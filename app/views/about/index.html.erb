            <p> A highly stylised and attractive logo that represents what it is to be a lynx. 
            The animal is centred in the design and its face occupies most of the space, showing a friendly 
            and welcoming expression. The lynx's eyes are large and prominent, with dilated pupils 
            suggesting curiosity and attentiveness, characteristics often associated with wisdom and cunning.</p>
            <p>The lynx is surrounded by a circle that acts as a frame, giving the logo a complete and bounded look. 
            Included in the design are several elements that allude to creativity and education, 
            such as pencils and a paintbrush, which are arranged symmetrically on either side of the lynx. 
            In addition, there is an open book just below the animal's paws, further reinforcing the theme 
            of education and learning.</p>
            <p>The colour palette of the logo is harmonious and consists mainly of earth tones, 
            with hints of brown and touches of brighter colours in the pencils and brush. 
            This selection of colours suggests a sense of approachability and warmth.</p>
